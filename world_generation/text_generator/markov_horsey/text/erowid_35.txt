Extreme Sweating, Salivation, & Ear Sogginess

Put 10 grams of powdered, non-grade-A Amanita powder into 24 capsules.

t -1 hour - took 1 dramamine tablet.
t0 - Swallowed the caps all at once on an empty stomach.
t1 - Vision blurred; tended to relax to near-focus only.  Extreme salivation, extreme sweating, soggy all around.  Showered.  Prepared oatmeal to nibble to hold off possible nausea.
t2-t6 - waited and waited, in this swamp, but the mental aspects never appeared.  No nausea.  Disappointing.  What to do with many, many more sub-grade A.M. capsules.

Warning: this caused swelling under tonsils, for two days.  Worse, this caused something like an ear infection which lasted 1 month and continues.  Want to take some metallic orange-gold grade-A caps, but afraid of ear problems.  This material must be the most unreliable in the world.

Absolutely recommend that you do not use this material until you have ample cannabis to counteract the salivation and possible nausea, and hopefully counter the sweating. A.M. + cannabis is a good pair, but not A.M. alone.
