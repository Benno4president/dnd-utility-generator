Being God,The Other Side,Mushrooms - P. cubensis & Ketamine,"I opened the large bag and took out what I eyed out to be about five grams of P. cubensis. One of the caps was rather large -much larger than a $0.50 piece. I put them in a smaller bag and saved them for later.I now eyed up about 700 mg of Ketamine. I ingested about 300 mg and about 3 grams of the mushrooms. 30 minutes passed, and I ingested the rest of the mushrooms (2 more grams). About five minutes later, I saw a small oval light, about the size of a quarter. I was about five or six feet in the air. It made its way down to level ground, and I was transformed into a world of kaleidoscopic colors and patterns.I began to look out into the distance and saw what appeared to be a face. At first it was only an eye. Then a nose and a moth, and finally the other eye. It was trying to tell me something, but I couldn't tell what. It's expression was difficult to distinguish. At first it looked happy, but then it was just a face. I could tell that considerable effort was put just to make itself visible.I leaned back down and realized my eyes were not open. I could see very clearly, more clearly than I ever could, all the different shapes and colors. I was inside my brain -or at least I thought. I could tell the difference from all the various chemicals and enzymes excreting from all the different glands. Each chemical would induce a different thought or feeling to the receptor that it would come in contact with.Everything was so clear. I could see and feel each of the endless colors. What I could see were no longer patterns, but they were structures. I could see and feel all the way around and inside them; all of them at the same time. I was one with everything. And everything was one with me. I opened my eyes, and I was outside and inside of the actual building was in. I was part of the wall and part of the people. I was part of time and part of space. I was time and I was space. I was all there was, and all there would ever will be. One would say I was a god. Hell, I'll say it myself: 'I am God'.At this point, I began to take control of what was mine, the Universe. I made some things happen, and I changed some things from happening. Then I just sat back and enjoyed my new Universe. Quite sometime later -I have no idea how long- I began to come down. I ate 200 mg more ketamine, and insulflated another 200 mg. Within minutes, I was back. The second time was not quite as high as the first, but very close. It was probably because the mushrooms were beginning to lose their effect.This was the best experience I have ever had. I see no way as to how it could be better. I went on -and not sure I came down yet- the biggest ego trip ever. On LSD I had been part of God, and I had all the knowledge there ever was. But this time I was God, and I created all the knowledge was mine. Other mushroom trips had not even come close.The ketamine had a very powerful effect. It had a dramatic decrease in the time it took for the journey to begin. This was the best experience I ever had -on anything. My theory is that a psychedelic drug uses so much of its energy to take you out of your body, and then uses it's remaining energy to show you what you need. But if you take a dissociative -please make yourself aware of dissociatives and brain damage-, the dissociative takes you out of your body first, so the other drugs can use all of it's energy to teach you. I didn't think this up from just this experience. But I have experimented with a few other different plants."
On Random and Chaotic Drug Use,Q.Public,Various,"I would like to submit this report as an inverse to many... 'I can't get enough' type reports...I'm 28 years old and I've been using various drugs since about the age of 17.I started on hash and due to the huge popularity of LSD and E a little while later I tried both and found LSD to be far more interesting and fun... ...for about 4 years from then I was either tripping or E'ing at least once a week from then on. I was smoking hash and grass every day. I also kept down a job in the computer trade for most of this time and only once were drug issues resulting in my leaving employment, (I resigned, I was in London (not my home town) and I was doing a fair bit of acid and at that point I just couldn't put up with the city anymore...)I must say that drugs have played a part in all of my long-term relationships with the opposite sex and none of these relationships have been very successful and ended badly... however I'm on ok terms with my ex's...Since about 95 (aged 24) I've been reasonably off of drugs, I don't take acid anymore (I finished it... before it finished me) and I don't do E... they are nothing like they used to be... I do smoke weed but never hash, I take a little cocaine ... very rarely ... and that's about it...The down side...? Well I'm on anti-depressants now and I believe this is due to a failed romance rather than anything else but I must admit I think I would be a little less susseptible had I not taken LSD, but... well I learned alot from LSD and I think perhaps I still have much to learn that I'd not even be aware of before I took it.I have tried Heroin a couple of times... once it had no effect perhaps because I was on mushrooms and 'shitloads' of freebased coke and the other time it was, well just fucking horrible. So maybe if you like feeling sick as fuck then its for you... it's not for me.Before I was 17 I started drinking at 12-13 and by the time I was 17 I was an alcoholic... and I quit when I started smoking hash... the grip of everything since the alchol has been minor...I smoked cigarettes since the age of 9 and now I smoke only in a joint and thats maybe two or three times a day...Finance...? I have never stolen to buy drugs, never have I had to choose between food or drugs, I have always been able to afford both.Violence...? I've had mildly violent relationships with my 'ex girlfriends due more to occasional drunkeness than drugs... although I'm not sure if this is me or drugs...I have mellowed now and this is certainly drug related !I've had very few violent incidents in my life and as I have only been attacked a couple of times, and none were drug related. Unless being mugged while stoned counts?I just want to make an account of a fairly normal life while taking various drugs with no major hassles. I may be even thought of as fairly dull... whatever.The ever present legal situation has led to much thought on the subject and has led me to simply think... who's business is it if I take drugs."
